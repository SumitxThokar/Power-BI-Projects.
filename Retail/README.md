This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a retail dataset, where the goal was to identify the main reason for loss in the business. After analyzing the data, we found that furniture items were the primary cause of loss. Further investigation revealed that the company was providing high discounts on furniture items, which was leading to a reduction in profit margins. This project highlights the importance of conducting EDA to identify the root causes of business problems and make data-driven decisions to improve profitability.
